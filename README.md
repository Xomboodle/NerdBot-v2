# NERDBOT 2.0

Yes that's right, there's already one of these.

The original Nerdbot reached a position where maintainability was not the most fun thing
to work with. And so, with that in mind, I elected to start again, building Nerdbot up
from scratch, with the work already completed as a baseline for what needs to be done here.

This new and improved version of Nerdbot will have, at the very least, all the features
that the original Nerdbot had (bar the `backflip` command, but that was originally there
to prove a point to someone). When complete, Nerdbot 2.0 will be more *maintainable*, as
*type-safe* as Python lets you be, and have a bunch of new *features* and QoL improvements.

### So what is Nerdbot?

---
Nerdbot is a bot constructed wholly in Python for the social platform Discord. Designed
to help with server engagement, it has a number of features already, such as:
- Insulting your friends
- Randomised spawns of collectables (with a leaderboard!)
- A mute tool, for those server members that get just a bit too annoying in chat
- And many more to come!

As of 5th Feb 2024, Nerdbot 2 officially went online in a select number of servers. It is
currently utilising JSON files as storage, but with its new host home, this will be steadily
migrated over to using a MySQL database for better data storage. Work for this is currently
ongoing.

### What about the old Nerdbot?

---
The original Nerdbot was first created on 5th Feb 2022, and has been successfully
running ever since. In that time, there were 6 major updates to the bot. After a fairly
long break of a few months from working on Nerdbot, I came back to realise that my
original design was... dreadful. And so, I decided to put the seal on development for
the original Nerdbot and start work on the one you see here, with the intention that when
finished, I can call this the 1.0 release. Sometimes, the best way to make progress is to
start from the beginning!

### What's new in Nerdbot 2.0?

---
Planned additions / changes:
- Separate leaderboards and tracking for both collectables (Implemented)
- Additional moderation commands (TBD)
- Increase verbosity of `help` command - get the help info for a specific command, rather
than the whole list (TODO)
- Improvements to data storage (In progress)
- Improvements to code readability and maintainability (In progress)
- New features for all users to play around with (TBD)

This list will be updated in the future once development has had more progress made.
